# Learn English Word

Preparation of an application that contributes to language learning by making word suggestions to its users.Word and word meanings were pulled from two different APIs using Axios. After creating an account, you can start learning vocabulary and add those words to your vocabulary table. You can also update your profile information.



## Requirements & Features

- User registration and login.
- Designing a Profile Page where user information can be recorded, displayed, and edited.
- The words that the user will learn will be drawn through the API and only one word will be reflected on the screen with their meanings. New word will be displayed after selecting “I learned” or “Remind later” option
- The number of words the user will learn will be limited to 10 and the user who fills the word limit will start playing again after waiting for 5 seconds (maybe 24 hours).
- Learned words will not be suggested to the user again.
- A screen will be developed where users can see the words they have learned
